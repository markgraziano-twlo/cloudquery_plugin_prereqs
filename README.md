## **What This Tool Does**
1. Updates **Homebrew** and **Python 3** (if already installed).
2. Installs or upgrades:
   - **GitHub CLI** (`gh`)
   - **CloudQuery CLI**
   - **CloudQuery Python SDK**
3. Sets up an **SSH key** for twilio-internal GitHub (if required).
   - The tool automatically checks if the SSH key `id_rsa_twilio_internal` exists on your Twilio work laptop.
   - If the key is missing, it generates a new one, adds it to the SSH agent, and uploads it to GitHub using the GitHub CLI.
   - üö® You must manually authorize your newly added SSH key for SAML SSO. The tool will automatically open the browser for you to perform that step. üåê
